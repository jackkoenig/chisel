As elaboration runs, Chisel constructs a hardware AST from these Modules. The compiler needs hooks to run before and after the actual construction of the Module object. In Scala, superclasses are fully initialized before subclasses, so by extending Module, Chisel has the ability to run some initialization code before the user's Module is constructed. However, there is no such hook to run after the Module object is initialized. By wrapping Module instantiations in the Module object's apply method (ie.
